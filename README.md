# save_to_zotero

A powerful command-line tool for saving webpages as high-quality PDFs and adding them to your Zotero library with proper metadata. Also supports adding existing PDF files to Zotero.

Note that this tool is quite new so if you find any bugs please open an issue!

## Personal Motivation

I created this tool after [Omnivore](https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore) shut down, as I was searching for a good multiplatform solution for reading PDFs. Zotero proved to be a promising alternative, especially with its HTML annotation feature. However, I needed something that would work on my phone too. Until a complete solution was available, I decided to build this tool to convert webpages to PDFs for use with Zotero across all my devices. Once saved via this tool, all content is fully accessible on your phone, tablet, and any other device with a Zotero client.

## Features

- Save any webpage as a high-quality PDF using Playwright's browser automation
- Works whether you use Zotero's or WebDAV backend for storage
- PDFs and webpages saved are accessible on all Zotero clients (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Add PDFs to Zotero with proper metadata extraction
- Support for existing PDF files without webpage sources
- Automatic metadata extraction from webpages (title, description, author, publication date)
- Integration with Zotero's connector API for better reliability
- Collection support for organizing your Zotero library (by name or key)
- Tag support for better organization of your Zotero library
- Human-like page scrolling and expansion of hidden content for better PDF captures
- Intelligent handling of dynamic content like accordions and dropdowns
- Smart title extraction for better file naming

## How It Works

save_to_zotero leverages several technologies to create a seamless experience:

1. **Webpage Capture**: Uses Playwright to render webpages with a real browser engine, capturing all content including JavaScript-rendered content, expandable sections, and proper formatting.

2. **High-Quality PDF Generation**: Creates PDFs with optimal formatting for reading and storage, including automatic expansion of hidden content, proper scrolling to capture all page elements, and preservation of images and formatting.

3. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts key metadata (title, description, author, publication date) from the webpage to create rich Zotero entries.

4. **Zotero Integration**: Communicates with your Zotero library through both the Zotero API and the Zotero Connector API to ensure items are properly indexed and accessible on all your devices (computer, phone, tablet) regardless of whether you use Zotero's storage or WebDAV.

5. **Anti-Detection Measures**: Uses randomized user agents and anti-fingerprinting techniques to bypass website restrictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Zotero desktop application (must be running during use)
- Zotero API key (for remote operations)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
uv pip install save-to-zotero
```

### Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/save_to_zotero.git
cd save_to_zotero

# Install the package and dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Save a webpage to Zotero
save-to-zotero --url="https://example.com/article"

# Add an existing PDF file to Zotero
save-to-zotero --pdf_path="/path/to/document.pdf"

# Add to a specific collection
save-to-zotero --url="https://example.com/article" --collection_name="Research Papers"

# Add tags to the item
save-to-zotero --url="https://example.com/article" --tags="research,important,to-read"
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Full options
save-to-zotero \
  --url="https://example.com/article" \
  --wait=8000 \
  --api_key="your_zotero_api_key" \
  --library_id="your_library_id" \
  --library_type="user" \
  --collection_name="Research Papers" \
  --tags="research,important" \
  --verbose=True

# For pages with complex JavaScript content, increase wait time
save-to-zotero --url="https://complex-site.com/article" --wait=10000
```

### Environment Variables

You can set default values using environment variables:

```bash
# Add these to your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.
export ZOTERO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID="your_library_id"
export ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE="user"  # "user" or "group"
export ZOTERO_COLLECTION_NAME="collection_name"
export ZOTERO_CONNECTOR_HOST="http://127.0.0.1"  # Default connector host
export ZOTERO_CONNECTOR_PORT="23119"  # Default connector port
export ZOTERO_USER_AGENT="your_custom_user_agent"  # Optional
```

## Configuration

### Connector Configuration

The tool communicates with Zotero through its connector API, which requires Zotero to be running. By default, it connects to:

- Host: http://127.0.0.1
- Port: 23119

These can be configured using environment variables if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Zotero Must Be Running**: The tool requires the Zotero desktop application to be running.
- **PDF Generation Issues**: 
  - Increase the wait time for complex pages with the `--wait` parameter (default is 5000ms)
  - For pages with infinite scroll, consider capturing a specific section rather than the entire page
- **Collection Not Found**: Ensure you're using the correct collection name exactly as it appears in Zotero.
- **API Authorization Errors**: Verify your API key has proper permissions and is entered correctly.
- **Connector Issues**: 
  - Ensure Zotero is running before executing the command
  - Check if Zotero is using a non-standard port (can be verified in Zotero's Advanced preferences)
